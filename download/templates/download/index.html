<p>pgAdmin is a free software project released under the <a href="../licence.php">PostgreSQL/Artistic licence</a>. The
    software is available in source and binary format from the
    <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/pgadmin/">PostgreSQL mirror network</a>. Because compiling from source
    requires technical knowledge, we recommend installing binary packages whenever possible.</p>

<p>The pages in this section give additional details about each binary package available as well as more direct
    download links. In addition, you can download source tarballs and pgAgent for your servers to enable additional
    functionality.</p>

<p>Finally, pgAdmin is included by default in many Linux distributions, such as RedHat, Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu.
    Please check your package manager for details.</p>
